# My First CTF Experience and Useful Resources for Beginners
Sharing my first CTF experience with tips, resources, and mindset advice to help newcomers kickstart their CTF journey



When I first joined the WiCyS Scholarship Program two years ago, I felt completely lost. I didn’t even know what a Capture the Flag (CTF) competition was! Before I could participate, I had to stop and research what a CTF actually meant in cybersecurity. From there, I learned step by step, Googling terms I didn’t understand, experimenting with tools, troubleshooting virtual machines, and slowly learning new things. 

It was very overwhelming at first, but also incredibly rewarding. That experience gave me new technical skills and problem-solving abilities that I use daily as a SOC analyst. Since many of you in the new cohort may be in the same place I was, I wanted to create this post as a one-stop guide with resources, mindset tips, and tools that helped me.
