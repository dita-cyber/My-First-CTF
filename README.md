# My First CTF Experience and Useful Resources for Beginners

When I first joined the WiCyS Scholarship Program two years ago, I felt completely lost. I didn’t even know what a Capture the Flag (CTF) competition was! Before I could participate, I had to stop and research what a CTF actually meant in cybersecurity. From there, I learned step by step, Googling terms I didn’t understand, experimenting with tools, troubleshooting virtual machines, and slowly learning new things. 

It was very overwhelming at first, but also incredibly rewarding. That experience gave me new technical skills and problem-solving abilities that I use daily as a SOC analyst. Since many of you in the new cohort may be in the same place I was, I wanted to create this repo as a one-stop guide with resources, mindset tips, and tools that helped me.

A Capture-the-Flag (CTF) is a gamified cybersecurity challenge where you solve puzzles—web, crypto, forensics, reverse engineering, and more to uncover a secret token called a flag (usually formatted like flag{...}). Along the way you practice investigative thinking, learn new tools, and see how systems really behave.

One of the most fascinating things about cybersecurity, in my opinion, is that while it’s a highly technical field, it also allows you to be very creative. For example, in a CTF there are so many different ways to capture a flag. You might not fully understand the concept of a task, how to solve it, or even the technical aspects of certain tools or commands if you haven’t been exposed to them yet—but you can still search for ways to find the answer, sometimes in ways you never imagined. Using creativity and thinking outside the box is a powerful exercise that helps develop analytical skills and broadens how you approach challenges.

I have one analogy to explain a CTF in a more relaitable way:

 


Video Game RPG

Imagine you’re the hero in a video game. You’ve just entered a dark dungeon. The goal? Find the treasure chest at the end, which in cybersecurity terms is the flag. The first hallway is quiet. You notice strange markings on the wall. At first, you have no idea what they mean. You try different thing like pressing on the stones, maybe shine a torch differently and suddenly, the wall shifts, revealing a hidden passage. That’s like your first CTF puzzle: experimenting until something clicks. Then you run into your first monster. It’s not too big, but it blocks the path. Luckily, a villager you met outside hinted, “Look carefully at its weakness, it can’t stand the light.” You shine your torch, and the creature dissolves into smoke. In a CTF, that villager is like the hint system or even a forum thread. You didn’t need to brute-force the fight, you just needed to listen, think, and apply the right tool. As you keep going, you battle tougher monsters: some require special weapons, others force you to decode riddles before they step aside. Each challenge you beat gives you a new skill or tool like technical tool in cyber Wireshark, Burp Suite, CyberChef... By the time you reach the final chamber, you’re not the same beginner who walked in. Finally, you find the treasure chest. You crack it open, and there it is: the flag.

**Why Virtual Machines Matter**

Although not every CTF challenge requires a Virtual Machine (VM), setting one up is one of the most valuable exercises you can do as a beginner. Having a VM will expose you to new knowledge and technology, and will almost certainly force you to troubleshoot issues that arise during setup. This process teaches you how to find information, follow technical steps, and work through problems systematically. These skills are the foundation of a career in cybersecurity, since this approach to tasks is used daily in the field. Gaining this experience allows you to practice patience, persistence, time management, critical thinking, attention to detail, and problem-solving by analyzing scenarios and approaching issues in different ways. All of this will be extremely valuable for future opportunities and your first job in cyber.

**Mindset for CTFs**

How to approach challenges and what to do if you get stuck

- Large, complex challenges can feel overwhelming and the key is to break them into smaller, manageable steps. One piece at a time and focus on making small progress. If you’re unsure where to start, try working backward from the current challenge. Thinking in reverse often reveals the key steps or missing information you need.
- Before diving into advanced challenges, make sure you have a strong foundation in the basics. CTFs often build on topics like networking, Linux commands, web technologies, cryptography, and scripting. To strengthen your skills read the challenge and read which topic it is about and research the fundamentals about that topic. 
- One of the most valuable skills in cybersecurity is the ability to research. When you come across an unfamiliar term, error message, or concept, use search engines to your advantage. Learn to refine your queries so you can quickly find documentation, forum posts, past challenge write-ups, and useful tools that can make your challenge way easier to be solved. 
- Begin with the simpler challenges first. This helps you build confidence, gather points, and stay motivated. Jumping straight into the hardest challenges when you’re new can be discouraging and may lead to frustration or giving up.
- If you’re stuck on a challenge for too long, don’t let it drain your energy. Skip it, move on to another challenge, and then return later with a fresh perspective. Often, stepping away gives your mind a break to spot something you missed the first time.
- Don’t be afraid to interact with others who have more experience. Let people know this is your first CTF, many will be happy to help. The key is not to ask for direct answers, but rather to ask how they would approach the problem. This way, you gain new perspectives and learn methods instead of shortcuts.
- CTFs are a community-driven learning experience. Share ideas, give small hints, and point others toward useful tools or approaches, but don’t spoil the answers (it’s against the rules and defeats the purpose). Even asking, “What do you think?” can open up discussions. If someone’s suggestion is way off track, guide them gently toward the right path with hints instead of solutions. Teaching and supporting each other reinforces your own learning and strengthens the community.
- CTFs are designed to be difficult, so frustration is part of the process. Embrace curiosity, persistence, and the willingness to try again after failing. Investigate every clue, test your ideas, and stay patient. Remember: every mistake is an opportunity to learn.
- After the CTF ends, take time to review what you’ve learned. Read write-ups from other players, especially for challenges you couldn’t solve. These often reveal new techniques and ways of thinking. Document your own process as well—both successes and failures. Over time, this becomes your personal playbook and a valuable resource for future challenges.
