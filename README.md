When I first joined the WiCyS Scholarship Program two years ago, I felt completely lost. I didn’t even know what a Capture the Flag (CTF) competition was! Before I could participate, I had to stop and research what a CTF actually meant in cybersecurity. From there, I learned step by step, Googling terms I didn’t understand, experimenting with tools, troubleshooting virtual machines, and slowly learning new things. 

It was very overwhelming at first, but also incredibly rewarding. That experience gave me new technical skills and problem-solving abilities that I use daily as a SOC analyst. Since many of you in the new cohort may be in the same place I was, I wanted to create this repo as a one-stop guide with resources, mindset tips, and tools that helped me.

____

The beginner-level CTF in the WiCyS program is designed to be approachable, fun, and educational. It’s a competition, but also a learning environment to acquire practice real cybersecurity skills, discover what areas interest you most (networking, forensics, web, crypto, etc.), learn persistence and creative problem-solving, and experience the “aha!” moments that make cybersecurity so exciting. With over 28 content packs and an integrated hint system, this CTF is perfect for beginners. Even if you’ve never touched a CTF before, you’ll come away with practical knowledge.

**Why Virtual Machines Matter**

Although not every CTF challenge requires a Virtual Machine (VM), setting one up is one of the most valuable exercises you can do as a beginner. Having a VM will expose you to new knowledge and technology, and will almost certainly force you to troubleshoot issues that arise during setup. This process teaches you how to find information, follow technical steps, and work through problems systematically. These skills are the foundation of a career in cybersecurity, since this approach to tasks is used daily in the field. Gaining this experience allows you to practice patience, persistence, time management, critical thinking, attention to detail, and problem-solving by analyzing scenarios and approaching issues in different ways. All of this will be extremely valuable for future opportunities and your first job in cyber.
